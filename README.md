# AuctionTracker
The goal of this program is to run a website that displays the Auction House status.

Process:
Step one: Scrape information from Bidly, Bidly reads information off of TWW. (scraper.js) -> (auction)
Step two: Paste information into auction_data.txt (scraper.js) -> (auction_data.txt)
Step three: Auction data is read by script.js and to be understood by index.html (aucton_data.txt) -> (script.js) -> (index.html)

Result:
User can find out what auction items are being listed without opening the TWW.
